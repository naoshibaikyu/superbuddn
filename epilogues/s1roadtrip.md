# ACT I

%

%The story begins with Scruffy, our favorite freak, rushing to Eris's door like there's an emergency. Instead of knocking the door, he blows a trumpet, making a loud disruptive noise waking the poor lady up.

Eris Shocked: It's 4 in the MORNING. What the heck???

Scruffy: It's an emergency! (opening the door, T-Posing right at the entrance)

Nadine Sad: (walking by, sleepy) Ugh... what is going on?

Scruffy: Roadtrip!

Eris Angry: What?

Scruffy Sad: We are going to be late to our roadtrip!

Eris Angry: How is this an emergency... I don't recall a road trip!

Scruffy: You did last night! You were like "Sure whatever... It's 1am, so let me sleep"

Eris Angry: I was clearly half asleep.

Nadine Confused: Also don't I get a say? I was never told about this!

Nadine Happy: But on second thought, it'd be fun to be away from the annoying skeleton brothers...

Scruffy Sad: Don’t be a downer, Eris!

Eris Angry: Good night.

Nadine Happy: ROADTRIP! ROADTRIP!!!

Scruffy: That's the spirit!

Eris Angry: Don't encourage him!

Nadine Sad: But things been so stressful here... I really want go out and explore the island while enjoying my time with my new friends.

Eris: (feeling guilty) ...Well, I guess that's fine...

Nadine Glad: Yay!

Eris Angry: But only under the condition *I* get to be the driver. I don't have much faith in Scruffy's sense of direction nor safety. ..No offense.

Scruffy Happy: Hey none taken at all! I don't trust me either.

Nadine Happy: I can't wait to see what this region have in store for us! So many sights to see. Ahhh..  I am so excited!!

%Later as they pack up

Nadine Happy: (packing) A toothbrush... hairbrush... some clothes...

Eris: Huh? We're only going to be gone for most of the day. We don't need to pack up much.

Scruffy: (stuffing comically large items into his small bag) ...a kitchen sink, a door, a sofa, some chairs, a portal gate, a space ship-

Eris Angry: WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT PACKING THOSE.

Scruffy: Never know when you need them!

Eris Angry: None of those are necessary!

%Nearby

Dino: (with binoculars) Hey boss.

Kranion Angry: What is it? Can't you see I am suntanning my bones?

Sticky: He's talking to me, diphead. I'm the boss! Now what is it?

Dino: It looks like Scruffy and the gang are going on a roadtrip! 

Sticky Angry: (snatches the binocular) Let me see...

Nadine Happy: (finished packing) I call shotgun!

Eris Happy: Alright, we do sight seeing and we'll come back by 7 in the evening at the latest. I got an early shift tomorrow, so let's make the most of it!

Scruffy Happy: Yay! Roadtrip! Roadtrip! Roadtrip!

Nadine Happy: Roadtrip! Roadtrip! Roadtrip!

%The trio finished preparing and enters the car.

Sticky: Hmm.... Let's give them a roadtrip alright. To HELL! Heheheh!! HAHAHAHAHAHA...!!

Kranion: (cracking his knuckles) Time ta beat those losahs. Hey Cranion!

Cranion: Nah, yah losers go have fun.

Dino: I'm no loser! Right boss?

Sticky: Shut it and get in the skull van!

Nadine Sad: (reading the map) Huh, this is really just a featureless barren wasteland.

Eris Annoyed: Turn to the other side.

Nadine: (turns it around) Oh! It seems the nearest stop is 5 miles from now.

Eris: That's good. We can take a little break.

Nadine: There is a little restaurant right there too.

Eris: Hungry?

Nadine Happy: Mm-hm!

Scruffy: (mindlessly playing paddle ball) 302, 303, 304, 305... (stops for a bit) I guess I can go for some funfetti chicken...

Eris Annoyed: Do you ever get tired of that bit?

Scruffy: What bit?

Eris Annoyed: Nevermind.

Scruffy: (continues) 306, 307...

%At the stop the trio enters the restaurant. Little do they know the skeleton trio has been following them...

Dino: H-Hey, Boss! I think I found them at the stop! 

Sticky: Perfect. I knew Scruffy couldn't resist the Funfetti Restaurant and I have an idea.

Kranion Angry: Ah brotha, here we go...

Sticky Angry: Can it! What was I gonna say... ah yeah-

Sticky: We slash their tires and then when they come back and try to start the car then we ambush them. Easy as pie.

Kranion: Yawn... that's lame and unimaginative.

Sticky Angry: Oh yeah? Why don't you come up witha better one if you're so smart.

Dino: ...

Kranion Angry: Uhh... 

Sticky Angry: Well?

Dino: Guys.

Kranion: Why don't we flatten their tires and then beat them to death! (crosses arms smugly)

Sticky Angry: That's the same exact plan as mine you nincompoop!!

Dino: Guys!

Sticky Angry: Shut up! We are doing a classic pointless brother to brother bickering!

Kranion Angry: Yah!! Shut it!!

%Eris's car goes past them.

Sticky: What the-

Kranion Angry: Dino! Why didn't you say anything?

Dino: I tried to!

Sticky: Whatever. After them!

%

Eris Annoyed: (completely deadpan) ...

Nadine Happy: (eating Funfetti cake happily)

Scruffy Happy: (eating Funfetti Chicken) Told you I wasn't doing a bit!

Eris Annoyed: ...

Nadine Happy: I've saved a slice for you!

Eris: Thank you Nadine but I've kinda lost my appetite.

Nadine Glad: More cake for me!

%Minutes later, Scruffy turns his back around and notices the Skull Van nearby.

Kranion: (holding a rocket launcher) Ready to fire, bro.

Scruffy: Huh, didn't expect to see them!

Nadine Confused: Huh? You said something?

Scruffy Happy: Don't worry about it, just talking to myself.

Nadine: Okay.

%Scruffy hastily tosses tiny spikes out of the window.

%**Pop!!**

Sticky: OUR TIRES!! WE'RE SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL!!

Dino Shocked: WHAT DO WE DO BOSS?!

Kranion: PANIC!!

Sticky Angry: I'M THE BOSS-

%The trio crashes into a nearby tree, Kranion's rocket launcher goes off hitting the tree and it falls over on the van, crushing it and blocking the road.

Nadine Confused: What was that?!

Scruffy Happy: Traffic.

Nadine: Must've been a real serious accident... right Eris?

Nadine Confused: Eris?

Eris: (asleep at the wheel) Zzzz...

Nadine Shocked: U-Uh- ERIS WAKE UP!! (attempts to steer the wheel in a panic)

Eris Shocked: H-Huh wh-

%The car swerves off road, the trio screams as the car drives nearly off the hill but Nadine hits the breaks on time.

Eris Shocked: Ugh... What happened?

Nadine Shocked: (shaken) Y-you fell asleep and we almost drove off the hill!

Eris Shocked: Nadine! I'm so sorry- I...

Nadine Happy: That was scary and fun!!! Can we do it again?

Eris Annoyed: ...No! I had enough near death crashing experiences in my life.

Scruffy: And how!

Eris: Nadine, can you drive in my place? I don't think I'm rested enough...

Nadine Sad: I never drove a car... No license either.

Eris: 

Scruffy Happy: You can count on me-

Eris Angry: No!

Nadine Happy: I can keep him in check! I promise we will be perfectly okay! You can change back when you rest enough.

Eris: Okay... Just make sure he doesn't somehow land us on a whole other planet or something.

Nadine: Uh, aye aye!

%The trio drives off again with Scruffy as the current driver. Eris rests in the back seat with the pillow and blanket that Nadine had packed. As minutes pass, Eris falls asleep.

Eris: (waking up) Mmmm..? (Looking at the window) Why are we in a desert... full of... mountains made of BARRELS?!

Scruffy: Oh hey! Funny story.

Eris Annoyed: Scruffy!! Are we in Barrel Canyon?!

Scruffy Happy: The interstate of Barrel Canyon!

Eris Angry: How?! I was just joking!!

Scruffy: (shrugs)

Nadine Confused: I've been keeping an eye out too. One moment I blinked and the next we are suddenly here! Interesting sight though! What's the problem?

Eris: WE AREN'T ON EARTH ANYMORE!

Nadine Shocked: What?!

Scruffy Happy: Haha yeah we're somehow on Ludicrous World! Buckle up! It'll be a wild ride!

Nadine Shocked: We... are on another planet? For real?

Eris Angry: How did this happened?! Tell me the truth! How long was I out?!

Scruffy: Dunno how we got here! (shrugs earnestly)

Nadine: And you were only asleep for like two minutes.

Eris Annoyed: ...

Scruffy: That's okay! It'll only take us 8 hours to get out of here!

Eris Annoyed: ... ...

Nadine Sad: ...Can't we just turn around?

Scruffy: Nope! We'd only hit an invisible wall! And if we touch the edges of the road, we will be blown back to the start!

Eris Annoyed: ... ... ...

Nadine: Sounds like a weird video game!

Scruffy Happy: But real!

Eris Annoyed: (curls into a ball)

Nadine: I guess I'll keep counting the utility poles we've been passing by. 230... 231... 232...

Scruffy: On the bright side, there is a really nice monument right at the end of the road!

Eris Annoyed: ... ... ... ...

Nadine: Ohh, is it worth it?

Scruffy Happy: You betcha it is!

Nadine Happy: How exciting and also grueling...

Eris Annoyed: (thud)

%Overwhelmed and exhausted, Eris drops asleep again.

Nadine Sad: ...Oh.

Scruffy: Eh, we'll be halfway through on the next stop.

Nadine Shocked: H-half way? (picks up map and looks at the back) Wow. It really is a barren wasteland... 380... 381... 382...

%Later...

Scruffy: Oh hey! A suspiciously highly detailed rat!

Nadine Happy: (looking at the sides of the road, spotting the rat) Ohhh... Weird!

Scruffy: Not as weird as the monument we're going to see!

Nadine Happy: Yay!

Nadine: ...

Nadine Sad: This is kind of boring...

Nadine Happy: Hey can I learn how to drive? It's a straight road so that can't be too hard, right?

Scruffy: Sure!

%Meanwhile

Kranion Angry: Oh!! That does it! We are really gonna make it personal!!

Dino: But boss, you've been making it personal the entire time.

Sticky Angry: (glares) I am the boss for the last time!

Dino: Sorry Boss Sticky...

Kranion Angry: (glares at Sticky) No! I am the Boss! And I am leading the charge! 

Dino: (sweating) C-Can't we work as a team or s-something?

Kranion Angry: What team? I'm only here because I have a personal vendetta against Nadine!

Sticky Angry: And I'm only here because I have a life-long personal vendetta against Scruffy AND my diphead brother.

Kranion Angry: Oh yeah? Why don't you fight me then, diphead?

Sticky Angry: I only brought you here so I can prove you wrong! I'll kill you another time.

Kranion Angry: Prove me wrong? Bro, you're still really on about that dumb robot thing?!

Sticky Angry: Says the idiot who still thinks she stole your wallet.

Kranion Angry: ...

Sticky: DINO! ETA on the repairs?

Dino: All ready, b-boss!

Sticky: And the rocket thrusters?

Dino: Installed and ready, sir!

Sticky: Excellent... Let's give them a surprise.

%

Nadine Happy: What happens if I press the gas and the brake at the same time?

Scruffy: The car takes a screenshot.

Eris Annoyed: (jolts up awake) Pull over. I’m driving now!

Nadine: Okay! (successfully stops the car) Oh hey, I did it right this time!

%As Nadine and Eris gets out of the car to swap seats...

Eris Shocked: (opening the driver seats door) Wait, do you hear that?

Nadine Confused: Sounds like its coming from behind-

Kranion: SURPRISE FUCKERS-

%The skull van zooms straight past them.

Sticky Angry: DINO! YOU IDIOT! WE WENT WAY PAST THEM! ***TURN AROUND!***

Dino Shocked: SORRY BOSS THE THRUSTERS ARE TOO FAST!! 

Kranion Angry: THEN PUT A BREAK ON THEM AND TURN!!

%The skull van swerves around but immediately gets blown away by the mysterious wind for going off road.

Sticky Angry: YOU IDIOTSSSSS....

%The skull van disappears from view.

Eris Annoyed: Huh? What was that all about?

Scruffy: (knowing smile) Heh heh beats me.

Nadine Confused: Huh... anyways... Are you well rested? You've only slept for two more hours. 

Eris: Yeah I think that was enough to keep me going for the rest of the... trip. Do we really have six hours more of this?

Scruffy: We can listen to the radio to pass time!

%

Nadine Confused: Hey, the radio host told us to "Press L to Learn". What does that mean?

Eris: No idea, this car has no L button.

Nadine Sad: Awww... it'll forever be a mystery...

Scruffy: (chewing on Funfetti chicken)

Eris Annoyed: Hasn't those gotten bad by now?

Scruffy: Not when they're injected with Funfetti!

Nadine Sad: ...

Eris: Okay, never mind. I don't want to know anymore.

Scruffy: I'm freaks.

%A low tone beep plays.

Nadine Sad: Don't tell me...

Eris Shocked: We're running out of gas!

Nadine Angry: I said don't tell me!

Eris: Do we have any back up?

Scruffy: (searching the bags) We don't have any gas canisters, so no.

Eris: When's the nearest gas station?

Scruffy: There's nothing here but a balloon store a several miles ahead.

Eris Annoyed: ...What? Why that of all things?

Scruffy: To buy balloons.

Eris Angry: That's not what I mean!

Nadine Sad: Are we even going to be okay?

%The last bit of gas finally gives out.

Nadine Sad: No!

Eris Annoyed: Anddd that's it. The gas is all used up. We're stuck. Stuck in this endless hell of an interstate. (slams her head on the steering wheel in utter defeat)

Nadine Sad: Eris...

%Scruffy thinks very hard til his head hurts bad then he gets an idea.

Scruffy: (clutching his head) One moment.

Nadine Confused: What are you doing?

%Scruffy gets out of the car then sits on the road.

Eris Annoyed: Wow. Even he has given up...

%Scruffy slowly levitates above the road and starts making engine noises.

Nadine Shocked: Uh...

Scruffy: Be back in a few minutes.

%VROOOM. Scruffy takes off like a car!

Eris Shocked: 

Nadine Shocked: 

Eris Shocked: 

Nadine Shocked: 

Eris Shocked: What the h-

%

%Sometime after the skull van is using its rocket boosters at near max speed.

Sticky: (as the driver now) ...

Dino: (noticing Sticky's ice glare) S-sorry Boss...

Kranion: (sideyeing) I don't care what it takes I wanna squash the annoying green girl.

Dino: Which one-

Kranion: The one with the hat! Duh!

Sticky: Quiet! I can see them now!

%Sticky gradually slows the boosters til the Skull Van comes at a stop slightly ahead of Eris's car.

Nadine: Wa-wait what?

Eris: Wait isn't that...

Sticky Angry: (stepping out of the van)

Kranion: Surprise fuckers!

Dino: Uh, yeah.

Eris: Ugh, it's them... What do you want?

Nadine: Have you been stalking us this whole time?!

Dino: Huh? When you put it that way-

Sticky: Dino, shut up.

Kranion: HA! Looks like they're both stranded!

Dino: Uh, boss. I thought Scruffy was with them?

Sticky Angry: Yeah, where is Scruffy?

Eris: ... 

Nadine: He's out there doing Scruffy things for a few minutes. Why?

Sticky: Shame because I wanted a triple murdernbut just you two will be enough!

Nadine: Why? What did we ever do to you?!

Kranion: You humilated me when you stole my wallet!

Nadine: It wasn't stolen for the last time!

Kranion: You still smashed my Skull Mobile!

Nadine: You did that to yourself!

Kranion: Nuh uh, I saw what you did you freak!

Eris Annoyed: ...Okay. But what did *I* do?

Dino: Uhh, you humilated me when I had the AB power...

Eris Annoyed: I don't remember ever fighting you...

Dino: You did and you defeated me in 2 seconds flat!

Eris Happy: Ah, that must be why I can't remember.

Sticky: (glaring at Dino) Talk about pathetic.

Dino: How dare you!! I wanna fight you now!!

Eris Happy: Sure. Let's see how long the fight last this time. Maybe a new record of 1 second?

Dino Shocked: YOU!!

Sticky Angry: Enough bickering you idiots and fight!

Sticky: (pointing at Nadine) But spare the little girl. I have some business to deal with.

Kranion: Whateva weirdo! Hey kid, let's fight.

Nadine: For the last time I'm not a kid!

Dino: (jumping in front of Eris slashing his saber at her) 

Eris Annoyed: (is an inch away) ...

Dino: (keeps flailing his arm)

Eris: (kicks him lightly)

Dino: AUGHHH (falls over in pain) T-This isn't over- (gets picked up) H-Hey!!

Eris Annoyed: (deadpan) If you keep talking I'll just toss you to the off road, alright?

Kranion: (holding a bazooka) Are ya scared yet?

Nadine: No.

Kranion Angry: Do you have a death wish?! Ya dang lucky my half bro wants you alive! (fires anyways)

Nadine Glad: (jumps onto the incoming rocket, bouncing on top of it and then stomps on Kranion's head)

Kranion Angry: WHAT TA FREA- (gets his legs swiped from a sweep kick, falling over and dropping his weapon)

Nadine: Hey, neat weapon. (holds up his bazooka)

Sticky: Seriously, brother?

Kranion: Ah shut up bro! You try taking the little runt on- (gets blown away by the bazooka and gets sent away from being out of the road's boundary)

Eris Shocked: Huh? Didn't know you had that in you, Nadine.

Nadine: Ah... heh um, my mom taught me a lot of self defense...!

Eris Annoyed: I see.

Dino Shocked: Please let me go...

Eris Happy: Gladly!

Sticky Angry: Dino! Diphead bro! You're both useless! Must I do everything myself?

Dino: S-sorry boss- (is dropped onto the sides of the road, followed by a scream cut short as he's flown off)

Eris: That just makes Sticky now.

Nadine: Got it! (click) ... (click) Huh, out of rockets already. (tosses away the bazooka) Not that I need it anymore...

Eris: Let's get this over with, Nadine.

%The two of them approaches closer to Sticky.

Sticky: (steps slowly away) So I'm outnumbered...

Nadine: That's right!

Sticky: (smirking) ...But can you outwit me?

Eris Shocked: (realizing) Wait! D-Don't take another step Nadine!

%Nadine steps on a hidden trap causing her and Eris to be suddenly trapped in a wire electrical net! The net instantly shocks them until they're unable to move.

Sticky: Hahaha!! YES!!! You both fell for the easiest trick in the book. 

Eris: Aggh... That's just dirty!

Sticky: My brother may be stronger but he sure lacks my wit. Too bad he's not here to witness what I'm about to do, but I'll be sure to record this.

Nadine: What are you talking about..?

Eris: A-Are you a psychopath??

Sticky: (getting out his tools) Silence you two! It's time to prove you're a robot!

Eris: What?? Me?

Sticky: Not you! (points his wrench at Nadine) Her!

Nadine Shocked: !

Eris Annoyed: Don’t lay a finger on her you lunatic!

Nadine Sad: ...

Sticky: And what are you going to do to stop me?

Eris: You...!! Stay back from her!

%Sticky opens the net briefly to pull Nadine out, holding her by her neck.

Eris: Nadine!

Nadine Angry: (flailing around) Ngh...!!

Sticky: Stay still so I can tear you apart-

%HONK HONK

Sticky: What??

%Suddenly a floating bus has its balloons popped and it comes crashing down onto Sticky, freeing Nadine from his grasp.

Scruffy: I'm back!

Eris Shocked: !!

Scruffy: Yo you won't believe what just happened! Funny story!

Nadine Sad: Can we just get out of here first.

Sticky Angry: (slowly crawling out from under the bus but stops short) Damn you, Scruffy!! Get me out!!

%Eris pulls an injured Sticky out and deathly glares at him.

Eris Angry: ...

Sticky Angry: ...

Eris Happy: Mind doing the honors, Nadine?

Nadine Happy: Gladly! (revs up her leg and kicks Sticky far)

Sticky Angry: I WILL REMEMBER THIS!! MARK MY- (gets sent flying by the boundary wind)

Eris: Now with that out of the way..

Eris Annoyed: Where were you all this time??

Scruffy Happy: I found an empty abandoned balloon store!

Nadine: What did you need a balloon store for?

Scruffy: To drop the abandoned bus I found onto Sticky.

Eris: Where did you find a bus- Wait you knew they were stalking us this whole time?

Scruffy: (obviously ignoring the other question) Found the bus at the gasoline store.

Nadine Happy: You got gas for our car?!

Scruffy: (already filling the gas tank) Sure did! Let's go see the momument!

Eris Annoyed: No, we are going home.

Scruffy Sad: Come onnn. We can exit right after. We are almost there! It is an hour away!

Nadine Happy: Yay!

Eris: Well if it makes Nadine happy... (I wanna see it too)

%Later once they reach the end of the road.

Scruffy Happy: There it is! The momument! Right there! (points forward)

Eris Annoyed: ...

Nadine Sad: ...

Scruffy Happy: Yep!

% Nadine and Eris slowly walks over to the "monument". It's a toilet. 

Eris Annoyed: ...

Nadine Sad: (reading the little sign next to it)

Nadine Confused: "A toilet randomly built in the middle of the desert. It doesn't have any purpose as there is nothing connected to it. Locals always theorized what was its purpose making it the Stonehenge of Ludicrous World."

Nadine Happy: Huh. Cool.

Scruffy Happy: Yeah isn't it??


Eris Annoyed: ...Right, cool whatever. Now where is the exit?

Scruffy: Don't you want to admire the momument longer-

Eris Annoyed: NOW!

Scruffy: (pulling his bag out of the car, digging into it then pulls out a door) Right here! 

Eris Shocked: You had a door with you?! But why?

Scruffy Happy: It's not just a door. It's a warp gate! We can leave back home whenever we want! (unfolds it and boots it up, opening the portal inside)

Eris: ...

Eris: ...

Scruffy Happy: I'm freaks.

Eris: You are?

Scruffy: Yep!

Eris: Me too. I'm freaks. I'm freaks.

Scruffy: Oh finally you've learn to become a freak like me- Uh.. Eris? What are you doing?

Eris: HAHAHA I'M FREAKS!! (lounges at Scruffy beating the daylights out of him while shouting "I'm freaks" over and over with exasperated laughter)

Nadine Sad: ...I'll be going home now...


%Back at Nadine's room.

Clara: (through text on phone) How was your day, cutie?

Nadine: Trip.

Nadine: Didn't enjoy the trip.

Selena: Mind elaborating?

Nadine Sad: No.

Clara: Well I'm sure tomorrow will be a better day.

Nadine Sad: I guess.

%A loud door slam can be heard. Nadine turns and sees Eris storming to her room and an injured Scruffy wobbles to his.

Nadine Sad: ...

Scruffy: Bones.
 
%

Dino: We've finally caught Nadine and Eris!! Yeah!!

Nadine Sad: (Sigh)

Eris Annoyed: You're lucky, you know that right? Lucky that we're battered from the heat and exhaustion! Lucky that we're trapped in this death road with no way out! Lucky that-

Kranion: Cope. Anyways, bro! Dino did the friggin' right thing for once!

Sticky: About time.

Dino: What should we do?

Kranion: Use them as bait for Scruffy!

Sticky: And while I'm at it, we can also expose the robot girl for who she is!

Eris Annoyed: What? I'm not a robot...

Sticky: Wasn't talking about you. I'm talking to (pointing at Nadine) her!

Kranion Angry: Ugh!! Yah still on about this, bro?

Sticky Angry: Watch it, diphead. You will finally realize I'm not the crazy one! 

Kranion Angry: Whatevah, lemme tear her apart anyways. I've got a bone to pick with her!

Nadine Annoyed: Is this still about the skull mobile?

Sticky: Can it, Kranion. I'm calling the shots here. I will make sure she will be torn apart...

Sticky Angry: ...professionally.

Nadine Shocked: (very nervous) U-um. What?!

Eris Angry: She's not a robot either, weirdo. Don't you lay a finger on her!

Sticky: Silence! Dino, get the tools and ***dismantle*** Nadine.

Nadine Happy: (interrupting) Hey how did you three end up here? Aren't we on Ludicrous World?

Sticky: ...

Dino: ...

Kranion: ...

Sticky Angry: Wait, **how** did we get here...??

Unknown: **HONK HONKKKK**

Dino Shocked: What the?

%Suddenly a floating bus has its balloons popped and it comes crashing down on the skeletons next to the girls.

Scruffy: I'm back!

Eris Angry: What the fuck?

Scruffy: Yo you won't believe what just happened! Funny story!

Nadine Sad: Can you just untie us first...
